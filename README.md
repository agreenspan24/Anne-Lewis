Anne Lewis Coding Challenge:

In order to run the following server, first please download the latest version of NodeJS, 
    which can be done at https://nodejs.org/en/. 

From there, move to the AnneLewis directory and run the following command "node server.js".

After running that command, open the file "teacher2teacher.html" in your favorite browser. 

That's it, enjoying seeing the latest tweets of @teacher2teacher, routed from twitter, saved on a local database, recalled by the server, sent over to a client, and displayed on your browser. Please let me know if you have any questions or run into any errors while reviewing!
